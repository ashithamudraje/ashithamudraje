## 👋 Hey, I'm Ashitha

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on computer vision, NLP, and multimodal AI. I build ML tools, models, and APIs that actually solve real-world problems — not just toy datasets.

### 🧠 What I Do
- Design, train, and deploy deep learning models using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face
- Build scalable ML pipelines and tools that plug into real applications
- Work across computer vision, NLP, and multimodal learning
- Develop full-stack AI features: from data to model to API

### 🛠️ Tech I Use
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Java, Javascript, C++
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face, OpenCV, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Docker, Git, GitHub Actions
- **Other**: ML Ops basics, REST APIs, data visualization

### 📁 Projects I’ve Built
I like building things that are useful, even if experimental. Some recent ones:
